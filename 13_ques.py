# TASK 13: The Power of Exponents (Arithmetic Operators)
# 🔹 Scenario:

# Jake is curious about how exponents work in Python!

# 📝 Your Task:

# Ask the user for a base number and an exponent.

# Use the ** operator to calculate the power.

# Print the result.

# ✅ Example:

# Enter base: 2

# Enter exponent: 3

# 2 to the power of 3 is 8


# ***Solution****
base = int(input("Enter Base : "))
power = int(input("Enter power : "))
print(F"{base} to the power of {power} is {base**power}")
